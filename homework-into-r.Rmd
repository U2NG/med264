```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 1. 

Look at the help for the c function. What kind of vector do you expect you will create if you evaluate the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
c(1, 2, 3)
c('d', 'e', 'f')
c(1, 2, 'f')`
```

## 2. 

Start by making a vector with the numbers 1 through 26. Multiply the vector by 2, and give the resulting vector names A through Z (hint: there is a built in vector called LETTERS).

## 3.
